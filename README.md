# GoGoApps
GogoApps is an application that paired with Apple Watch which is intended for those who like to cycling together (Gower). This app helps them accommodate cycling participants in preparations such as determining the schedule and choosing a route.
GogoApps also helps them when cycling. This application can track and find out the order of each member in a cycling activity.
GogoApps is also equipped with an SOS message that will send a signal to all participants via Apple watch. So participants don't need to use their iphone to call somebody to get first aid.
